# Artist Statement

The inspiration for my colour-picker comes from one of the example volume sliders that used the classic game Snake as its interface, this allows for users to already be familiar with the controls. Therefore, I decided to base my colour-picker off Atari Breakout. The challenge in using this colour-picker comes in two forms, the challenge of operating the interface and the challenge of being lucky (as the colours available to the user are randomly selected from what’s possible with p5.js). Using the interface itself can be challenging as the user must make their way towards the colour they want, with the possibility that they might not select the colour quick enough and that the selected colour could become one they don’t seek. However, seen the user can lock in colours and given that users can acquire a new selection of random colours at any time balances this challenge. The danger with this approach is that the user may get caught up in the experience offered by the interface rather than using it for its intended purpose. I am using the iconic look to conjure interest and invoke childish joy whilst giving users a viable tool.
